# Anki Card Builder

> [!NOTE]
> The extension only works for French words that need to be translated to Bulgarian. I have not yet made the tool more generic, but I hope to do so in the future.

## What is Anki Card Builder?

Anki Card Builder is a little browser extension made to take the pain out of making language flashcards for Anki.

Normally, when you find a new foreign language word, you have to do something like this:

- Look up the translation in a dictionary
- Find an example sentence
- Translate the example sentence
- Check the word’s gender and plural form
- Hunt down an audio pronunciation
- Search for a picture that matches
- And finally, copy and paste everything into Anki

That’s a lot of steps, and it gets old fast.

With Anki Card Builder, all of that busywork is done for you automatically.
Just highlight a word, and the extension gathers everything.

## Why is this project useful?

- **Save time**: No more endless searching, copying, and pasting. You can build cards in seconds.
- **Richer cards**: Get translations, example sentences, grammar details (like gender and plural), pronunciation audio, and images—all in one place.
- **You stay in control**: Edit and double-check everything before the card goes into your deck.
- **Stay organized**: All your cards look and feel consistent, every time.
